              At Little Lemon, our journey began with a simple yet powerful
              idea: to create something that makes a difference. It all started
              in 1990 when a small group of passionate individuals came
              together, driven by a shared dream to innovate and bring change to
              the Hospitality Industry. What started as a humble beginning has
              now blossomed into a thriving endeavor that continues to touch the
              lives of countless people. In the early days, our founders had one
              mission - to provide solutions that genuinely improved the
              everyday experience of our customers. With nothing more than
              dedication, a relentless pursuit of excellence, and a vision to
              leave an indelible mark on the industry, they set out to build a
              brand that stands for quality, integrity, and innovation.
